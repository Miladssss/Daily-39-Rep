# Teneo & DePIN Intro

## What is Teneo?
Teneo is a decentralized, permissionless network of community nodes that unlocks real-time public social data streams. Users contribute via lightweight nodes (like a browser extension) and earn rewards while providing open data for builders, AI, and apps.

## What is DePIN?
DePIN stands for **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks**. These are blockchain-powered networks where contributors provide real-world resources (like sensors, bandwidth, or data) and get rewarded with tokens. They replace centralized platforms with community-driven infrastructure.

## Why it matters
- Teneo applies DePIN ideas to **real-time social data**.
- Participants run nodes, contribute signals, and earn tokens.
- Developers and AI systems can use this data for apps, analytics, and innovation.
